        <title>Javascript: The Good Parts</title>
        <author>Douglas Crockford</author>
        <publisher>O'Reilly</publisher>
        <description>Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole-a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code.</description>
